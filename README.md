## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

# Why vue.js? 
It easy to create a views/routes using it. I don't need to worry about template rendering, dom processing and these kind of tasks.

# Possible improvements:
* Do not allow empty name in the ranking (I'm not validating it);
* I focused on the game logic so the tayout is really simple. A lot could be improved for sure;
